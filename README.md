Kolmogorov Semigroups and Stochastic Gradient Monte-Carlo
---------------------------------------------------------

From the introduction:
> Kolmogorov semigroups are a natural way of describing time evolution of ItoÌ‚ diffusion
equations. These equations are an important class of so-called Langevin equations fre-
quently used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and have been shown to
be closely related to the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
